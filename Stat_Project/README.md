# 🧪 Taxi Fare Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

This project investigates whether payment type (cash vs. card) influences fare amounts in taxi trips. Using a cleaned dataset of over 2 million records, I applied statistical hypothesis testing and data visualization to uncover actionable insights for business decision-making.

## 📌 Objective

To determine if there's a statistically significant difference in fare amounts between card and cash payments using hypothesis testing techniques.

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: NYC Taxi Trip Records (2021) (public dataset)
- Original size: 6.4M+ rows
- Final cleaned size: 2.3M+ rows after removing nulls, duplicates, and outliers

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Statistical Methods**: T-test, IQR filtering  
- **Visualization**: Histograms, Boxplots, Stacked Bar Charts, Pie Charts  

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed 1% null values and 3.3M+ duplicates  
   - Applied IQR method to filter out extreme fare outliers  
   - Final dataset: 2.3M+ rows

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of fare amounts by payment type  
   - Passenger count vs. payment behavior  
   - Visualized trends using multiple chart types

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Null Hypothesis (H₀): No difference in fare amounts between card and cash payments  
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Card payments result in higher fare amounts  
   - Result: **p-value = 0.0**, rejecting H₀ with high confidence

4. **Business Insight**  
   - Card payments dominate 67.3% of trips  
   - Average fare for card: ₹1,311 vs. cash: ₹1,175  
   - Suggests potential revenue optimization by encouraging card usage

## 📈 Results

- Statistically significant difference in fare amounts by payment type  
- Card payments associated with higher average fares  
- Visual insights support targeted strategies for driver earnings and payment incentives
